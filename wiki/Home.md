# Welcome to the Deep Research Agent Wiki

The **Deep Research Agent** is a sophisticated autonomous research assistant built on top of [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). Unlike standard RAG systems, it doesn't just retrieve information; it iteratively investigates, validates, and synthesizes knowledge.

## 🌟 Philosophy
We believe that AI research should be **transparent**, **iterative**, and **verifiable**. This agent is designed to:
1.  **Understand** the nuance of a user's request.
2.  **Strategize** the best way to uncover hidden information.
3.  **Validate** findings by looking for gaps.
4.  **Collaborate** with humans via an "Interrupt & Review" pattern.

## 🗺️ Wiki Navigation
Use the sidebar to explore specific technical areas of this project:
- **[[The Research Graph]]**: Understand the nodes, edges, and state management.
- **[[Gap Analysis and Self Correction]]**: How the agent improves its own research.
- **[[Advanced Memory]]**: How we use Long-term Stores and local Vector DBs.
- **[[Persistence and Thread Management]]**: State vs. Storage concepts.
- **[[Human in the loop]]**: Details on the Approval/Modification flow.
- **[[Setup Guide]]**: Environment variables and local LLM configuration.

## 🚀 Quick Start
If you just want to run the agent, check the `README.md` in the root of the repository. This wiki is intended for developers who want to understand the inner workings of the graph.
